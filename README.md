Mockuments 📄

Mockuments is a specialized React-based tool designed for Content Designers and QA Engineers to generate high-fidelity "scanned-style" dummy documents. It is specifically built to test OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engines by simulating physical document artifacts.

🚀 Features

🌍 Multi-Region Support

Global Regions: UK, Australia, USA, France.

Auto-Localization: Automatically adjusts Currency (£/$/€), Date Formats (DD/MM vs MM/DD), Tax Labels (VAT/ABN/Tax ID), and Tax Rates.

🏭 Generation Engines

Manual Mode: Precision control for creating specific test cases (e.g., custom supplier names, dates, and totals).

Automated Mode: Bulk generation (up to 50 docs) using randomized datasets for stress testing.

📄 Document Types

Costs: Receipts, Invoices, ATM Withdrawals.

Sales: Sales Invoices, Sales Receipts.

Vault: Insurance Policies, Tax Filings, Tenancy Agreements (includes auto-generated placeholder text).

🤖 OCR Simulation

Flattened Output: Documents are captured as high-resolution images and wrapped in PDFs to ensure OCR engines must process the visual data rather than reading text layers.

Scanned Aesthetic: Applies SVG turbulence noise (paper grain) and random subtle rotation (-0.75° to 0.75°) to simulate a physical scanner feed.

🎨 Visuals

Deep Dark Mode UI.

Live Preview: Real-time visual feedback of the document layout before generation.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Framework: React

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Icons: Lucide React

PDF Engine: html2canvas + jsPDF

Bundling: JSZip (for bulk downloads)
